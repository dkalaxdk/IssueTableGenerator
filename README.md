# GirafReleaseDesigner
This python script will generate a markdown table, containing the issues and pull requests, closed in a given time period within Giraf.
It will also add a relation between issues and pull requests, if the naming convention from the project is used.
To use this script, a developer code needs to be made through [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens), and placed in the config file.
Within the config file, a start and end date can also be defined, as well as the repositories that should be scanned.
